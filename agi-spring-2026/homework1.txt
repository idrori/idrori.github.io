AGI, Spring 2026, Homework 1

1. Install, build, and run Claude Code with plugins:
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
claude update
claude
/plugin install frontend-design@claude-plugins-official
/plugin install claude-code-setup@claude-plugins-official
/plugin install claude-md-management@claude-plugins-official
/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official
Example: "build a webapp using the frontend-design plugin that does X Y Z, use the superpowers plugin."


2. Run Claude Code in a continual learning self-improvement loop:

In terminal:
claude update (good morning)

claude (do this in multiple terminals in different directories for multiple projects)

In Claude Code: (for each project)
/init (will read and understand the repo and the existing skills and tools)
use the claude-code-setup plugin (will install and load new plugins, tools, and skills required for this project)
use the superpowers plugin (will interview any expert user in any field, brainstorm, create specs and plan, and ask for permission to implement, and get an aha/wow response from the expert)
use codex/gemini subagent (ie strawberry toolkit etc, to review and verify the work using a different model family)
use the claude-md-management plugin (will save the knowledge, skills learnt in this session)
/exit (will terminate the session and exit, having performed work, updated memory, and learnt new skills by the above)

Repeat 


2. Setup mouse buttons to control yes/yes and don't ask again/no approvals, and voice as input.

3. Use Age of Empires / Warcraft / Starcraft II or other interface you like to visualize and manually control at least a dozen agents.

4. (Optional extra credit) Use any open source repo like AlphaStar to automatically manage the agents.
