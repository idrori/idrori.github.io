AGI, Spring 2026, Homework 1

1. Install, build, and run Claude Code with plugins:
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
claude update
claude
/plugin install frontend-design@claude-plugins-official
/plugin install claude-code-setup@claude-plugins-official
/plugin install claude-md-management@claude-plugins-official
/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official
..
/init
Example: "build a webapp using the frontend-design plugin that does X Y Z, use the superpowers plugin."

Best practices:
Use the superpowers plugin
At the beginning of an existing project session use /init and the claude-code-setup plugin
At the end of a session use the claude-md-management plugin


2. Setup mouse buttons to control yes/yes and don't ask again/no approvals, and voice as input.

3. Use Age of Empires / Warcraft / Starcraft II or other interface you like to visualize and manually control at least a dozen agents.

4. (Optional extra credit) Use any open source repo like AlphaStar to automatically manage the agents.
