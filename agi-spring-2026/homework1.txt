AGI, Spring 2026, Homework 1
Prof. Iddo Drori, last updated 1/23/26

1. Install, build, and run Claude Code with plugins:
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
claude update
claude
/plugin install frontend-design@claude-plugins-official
/plugin install claude-code-setup@claude-plugins-official
/plugin install claude-md-management@claude-plugins-official
/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official
Example: "build a webapp using the frontend-design plugin that does X Y Z, use the superpowers plugin."


Run Claude Code in a continual learning self-improvement loop:

In terminal:
claude update (good morning with daily updates, Claude Code is writing Claude Code)

claude (do this in multiple terminals in different directories for multiple projects)

In Claude Code: (for each project)
/init (will read and understand the repo and the existing skills and tools)
use the claude-code-setup plugin (will install and load new plugins, tools, and skills required for this project)
use the superpowers plugin (will interview any expert user in any field, brainstorm, create specs and plan, and ask for permission to implement, and get an aha/wow response from the expert)
use gpt/codex/gemini subagent (ie strawberry toolkit etc, to review and verify the work using a different model family)
use the claude-md-management plugin (will save the knowledge, skills learnt in this session)
/exit (will terminate the session and exit, having performed work, updated memory, and learnt new skills by the above)

Once every few sessions review all: zip the directory and attach it Gemini-3-Pro/GPT-5.2 Pro 
and ask it to review the data, prompts, and code and feed the review back to Claude Code

Repeat


2. Setup mouse buttons to control yes/yes and don't ask again/no approvals, and voice as input.

3. Use Age of Empires / Warcraft / Starcraft II or other interface you like to visualize and manually control at least a dozen agents.

4. (Optional extra credit) Use any open source repo like AlphaStar to automatically manage the agents.

You can sign up for the free gemini-3 pro plan for students.

Submission:
Submit all deliverables (prompts, code/screenshots) on the shared class Google Drive
under the subdirectory with your name, e.g. Homeworks/1/Your Name/
Put everything for this homework inside your folder.
Include a short README.md (or README.txt) at the top of your folder describing:
what you did, where each deliverable is located, how to run your code/webapp (commands, dependencies).
Make sure any notebooks/code run without needing your local paths (use relative paths where possible).
Use an LLM (Gemini or GPT) to review and revise your work before submission.

Out: 1/26/2026, due: 2/7/2026, 10 points.
