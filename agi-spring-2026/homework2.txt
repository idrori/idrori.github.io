AGI, Spring 2026, Homework 2
Prof. Iddo Drori, last updated 2/5/26


In this homework, you will use a team of AI agents to work on a small open math or theoretical CS problem by vibe proving with formal verification.


1. Installation and setup:
Update Claude Code to the latest version and use Opus 4.6
Install the free student version of Gemini-3 Pro
Use GPT-5.2 Pro Extended thinking if available (otherwise Gemini-3 Pro Thinking)
Ask Claude Code to enable agent teams
Ask Claude Code to install an open source Claude Code Lean agent prover, such as https://github.com/project-numina/numina-lean-agent
Claude Code will install Lean (~5GB)
Use https://live.lean-lang.org to check that a simple Lean program compiles.
Do a Lean game https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4

2. Team
Choose a small open problem in natural language (into problem.txt)
Ask GPt-5.2 Pro Extended thinking what team would be best to solve and explore the problem from diverse angles including an AI formal prover.
Ask Claude Code to create the team


3. Autoformalization with cycle consistency:
Ask Claude Code to use the team and agent to formalize the problem in Lean (into problem.lean)
Ask Claude Code to check that the Lean compiles
Ask Claude Code to back translate the compiled Lean into natural language (into problem.lean-nl.txt)
Ask GPT-5.2 Pro Extended thinking to check if the original problem (problem.txt) in natural language is mathematically equivalent to the back-translated problem (problem.lean-nl.txt).
If they are not equivalent, then ask the team and agent to fix the Lean formalization
and repeat for 3-5 rounds, until the problem formulation both compiles, and its back translation is mathematically equivalent to the original problem.


4. Natural language proof with sub-problems:
Ask GPT-5.2 Pro Extended thinking to solve the problem using a generator-verifier prompt:

Instructions

You are solving an open problem. These are unsolved problems — most have resisted expert attacks. A rigorous partial result or a well-documented failure is more valuable than a fake proof.

What to do

1. Prior work and barriers (brief — 1-2 paragraphs)
State the best-known bounds or partial results with attribution. Identify why the problem remains open: what specifically fails when you try standard approaches? If you recognize the problem, say what is known. Do NOT pad this section with textbook definitions.

2. Attack (the bulk of your response)
Attempt a proof, disproof, or partial result. Requirements:

* Number all major logical steps (Step 1, Step 2, …).
* Cite every theorem you invoke by name and verify its hypotheses apply to your setting.
* If a step requires an unproven claim, mark it with  and state it as a conditional: “If X holds, then…”
* If you reach an impasse, document exactly where and why the argument breaks. Then try an alternative approach. Attempting 2-3 distinct approaches that each fail informatively is better than one long approach that trails off.
* If you cannot improve on known results, say so explicitly. Do not repackage known bounds as new results.

3. Verification
Before finalizing, re-examine your argument adversarially:

* For each key step, ask: Would a skeptical referee accept this? Is any implication actually an equivalence? Are quantifiers in the right order?
* Check: do boundary cases (n=1, 2, 3) or degenerate cases break the argument?
* Check: Did you use any theorem whose hypotheses you did not verify?
* Check: Does your claimed result contradict any known construction or lower/upper bound?
* If you find an error, fix it or downgrade your claim. Do not leave a known error in the final output.

Common failure modes to avoid

* Survey masquerading as progress: Summarizing known results without contributing anything new. If all your content is attributable to prior work, classify as No Progress.
* Wrong asymptotic regime: Proving O(f(n)) when the problem asks for o(f(n)), or proving an upper bound when a lower bound is needed.
* Unverified theorem application: Invoking a theorem (Szemerédi Regularity, Hales-Jewett, etc.) without checking that your objects satisfy its hypotheses.
* Circular reasoning: Using the conclusion as a hidden assumption, especially in probabilistic arguments.
* Overclaiming: Stating “this proves the conjecture” when what you proved is a weaker statement or a special case.

Output Format

Prior Work

[Best known results, key references by author name, and why the problem is open.]

Approach

[Which strategy do you choose and why. If multiple approaches were attempted, describe each.]

Solution / Analysis

[The complete mathematical argument with numbered steps. If partial, clearly state what is proved vs. what remains open. Mark conditional steps with .]

Verification

[Your self-check. For each key deduction, state whether it survives scrutiny. If you found and fixed errors, document them.]

Result

* Status: [Solved / Major Partial Result / Minor Partial Result / Documented Failure / No Progress]
* What is proved: [One sentence stating your strongest unconditional result, or “No new result beyond known bounds.”]
* Open sub-problems: [If applicable, specific sub-problems whose resolution would complete the proof.]


GPT-5.2 Extended thinking will answer (~up to 30 minutes), ending with open sub-problems and optionally suggest a deep dive: “If you want, I can…”
Respond “yes, and work on the open sub-problems.”
Repeat for 3-5 rounds (up to ~15-30 minutes each)
Save the entire concatenated conversation (~2 hours) into a solution.txt file.


5. Proof:
Ask Claude code to 
Ask Claude Code to use the team and agent to formally solve the problem (into proof.lean), given:
Problem in natural language (problem.txt)
Problem in Lean (problem.lean)
Concatenated answer of GPT-5.2 Pro Extended thinking (solution.txt)
Ask Claude Code to use the team and agent to check that the Lean proof compiles, without sorry statements.
